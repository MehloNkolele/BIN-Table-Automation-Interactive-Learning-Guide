## Live Project

[View the live project here.](https://mehlonkolele.github.io/BIN-Table-Automation-Interactive-Learning-Guide/)

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive learning guide designed to provide an in-depth look at the User Stories and System Requirements for Absa's BIN Table Automation initiative. The goal is to help users understand the current manual processes, the problems associated with them, and the proposed automated solution.

The application is a single-page HTML application with tabbed navigation to explore different aspects of the project, including an overview, user stories, system requirements, key concepts, and a knowledge check quiz.

## Languages & Frameworks

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling the application, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For interactive elements like tabs, collapsible sections, glossary functionality, and the quiz.

No external frameworks are used for the core functionality to keep it lightweight and focused on fundamental web technologies.

## Setup & Access Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory.**
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

    ```bash
    # Example: If you have a local server or just opening the file directly
    # On Windows, you can double-click index.html
    # Or, from a command line in the project root:
    start index.html
    ```

    Alternatively, if you are using a simple HTTP server (like Python's http.server or Node.js's http-server) to serve the files, you can run:

    For Python 3:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown) in your browser.
